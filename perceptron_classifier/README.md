### Python Perceptron Classifier

This project implements a binary Perceptron classifier from scratch in Python. Meant to showcase object-oriented python programming and basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.

The classifier expects training data in this format:
[label, feature1, feature2, ..., featureN]

The label should be a -1 or 1, features can be any float or integer number.
Example data:
[1, 0.243, 0.892, -0.731] 
[-1, -0.471, 0.623, 0.554] 

This classifier could be used as a substitute for the scikit-learn SVM classifier used in the 'svm_classifier_notebook' that is also in this code_samples repo.
