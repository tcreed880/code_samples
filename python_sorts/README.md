# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This folder contains basic implementations of the **bubble sort** and **merge sort** algorithms, written from scratch in Python.

The goal is to demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills, including:
- Writing custom functions
- Generating random data
- Measuring execution time
- Plotting performance with `matplotlib`

These examples are useful for showcasing an understanding of algorithm design and performance comparisons between sorting methods.
