## Sorting Algorithms in Python

This folder contains basic implementations of the bubble sort and merge sort algorithms in python. Includes measuring of execution time for sorts and plotting of performance with different array sizes. 

These are not optimized for real-world use, they’re just meant to demonstrate basic Python function writing and understanding of sorting algorithms.

### Time Complexity

Bubble Sort: Worst-case and average time complexity is O(n²). A very inefficient sort for large arrays.

Merge Sort: Much faster with O(n log n)time complexity.
